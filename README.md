### ‚úÖ Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

**Problem Statement:**

Write a Python program that:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Checks whether the number is even or odd using an `if-else` statement.
3. Displays the result accordingly.

**Sample Output:**
Enter the Number: 7
7: is Odd Number

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

**Problem Statement:**

Write a Python program that:
1. Uses a `for` loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2. Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3. Displays the final sum.

**Sample Output:**

The sum of 1 to 50 is : 1275
